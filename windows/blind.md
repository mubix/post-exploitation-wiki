# Windows Blind Files

In some cases during exploitation you as an attacker gain the ability to read arbitrary files. As an attacker you need go-to files that cover as many different OS versions as possible in order to either confirm exploitation or gather intelligence on the exploited system. For this we use a "blind file".

| File	   | Description / Importance | OS Version |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\boot.ini`  | Used in the booting sequence for the Operating System. | Found on XP and earlier. |
| `%WINDIR%\win.ini`  | Stores basic boot settings. [Wikipedia reference.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIN.INI) Note that on a fresh Windows XP install, this file may exist but be empty. | Found on XP and earlier. |
